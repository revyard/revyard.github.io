<p><strong>4. What characteristic describes a formal code review?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Code is automatically sent for review by source code management systems once it is checked in.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The entire code base is reviewed in a series of meetings.</strong></span>
    </li>
    <li>It utilizes a peer code review tool to identify code that needs retesting.</li>
    <li>It provides direct interaction between the review team and the code author.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> In a formal code review developers have a series of meetings to review the whole code base
        and go over the code line by line, discussing each one in detail. The formal code review process promotes
        discussion between all of the reviewers.</p>

    <li>deliver as fast as possible</li>
    <li>amplify learning</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The Lean SDLC methodology is built on seven principles which are focused on minimizing waste
        and maximizing value to the customer. The principle of eliminating waste is the most fundamental and it is the
        one from which all the other principles flow.</p>

<p><b>10. What is clean code?</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>code that has no reviewer comments</li>
    <li>code that has passed functional testing</li>

    <li>code that performs a discrete task</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Clean code is code that meets common principles that make it easy to read and understand.
        Some of these principles are as follows:<br />
        Neat formatting to generally-accepted practices<br />
        Code intuitive variables and objects<br />
        Documented with appropriate comments<br />
        Written so that it can be reused and easily unit-tested</p>

<p><b>12. What is the role of the view component in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) flow?</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It accepts selected data and displays the visual representation to the
                user.</strong></span></li>
    <li>It accepts the input and applies the required rules to format the data.</li>
    <li>It requests user input and manipulates it to fit the format for the model.</li>
    <li>It manages the data, logic and rules of the application.</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern abstracts code and responsibility into three
        distinct components: model, view, and controller. The controller accepts the input, manipulates the data, and
        sends the manipulated data to the model. The view is the visual representation of the data. There can be
        multiple representations of the same data.</p>

<p><b>13. A developer is constructing some functions in Python. When is a function referred to as a module in
        Python?</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>when the function is declared during the execution of a Python program</li>
    <li>when the function is initiated during the execution of a Python program</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>when the function is packaged in a single Python file</strong></span></li>
    <li>when the function is used for the first time</li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> Modules are a way to build independent and self-contained blocks of code that can be reused.
        A module consists of a set of functions and typically contains an interface that allows for integration with
        other modules. A module, in Python, is a Python file with packaged functions.</p>

<p><b>14. A student is learning Python using the interactive interpreter mode. The student issues these commands:</b>
</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Uri():
... def_init__(self, host, prot):
... self.host = host
... self.prot = prot
... self.url = self.prot + "://" + self.host
&gt;&gt;&gt;</pre>
<p><b>Which command should the student use to create an object with one attribute being a valid URL?</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>&gt;&gt;&gt; url2 = Url(URL, &#8216;http://&#8217;, &#8216;www.cisco.com&#8217;)</li>
    <li>&gt;&gt;&gt; url2 = Url(&#8216;http&#8217;, &#8216;://&#8217;, &#8216;www.cisco.com&#8217;)</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>>>> url2 = Url(&#8216;www.cisco.com&#8217;,

</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> In Python, classes are a means of bundling data storage and functionality in a single
        structure. Each class declaration defines a new object type. As with other Python data structures and variables,
        class objects are instantiated as they are first used, rather than being predeclared, by using an assignment
        statement.</p>

<p><strong>15. A developer issues a Linux command <ocde>python3 -m venv devenv</code> . What is the developer trying to
            achieve?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>to activate the Python 3 virtual environment named devenv</li>
    <li>to enter the Python 3 virtual environment named veny using the devnet tool sets</li>
    <li>to install the devnet tool sets in the Python 3 virtual environment named veny</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>to create a Python 3 virtual environment named devenv</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="message_box success">
    <p><b>Explanation:</b> The syntax for creating a Python 3 virtual environment in a Linux system is python3 -m venv
        virtual_environment , where venv is the Python 3 module to create a virtual environment and -m is the switch to
        tell Python 3 the venv module is to be used.</p>
